# Homework 1

## Trust Machine
In order to reduce massive trust processes in large institutions, such as governments, banks, or other financial firms, a new technology have been developed to reduce the huge cost of these processes while keeping their business still trustworthy. This new technology is called 'Trust Machine', due to the purpose to replace 'Trust companies.'

one feature of this machine is decentralisation. this feature prevents hazards when the central authority has been attacked by DDoS or some corruptive insiders try to gain illegitimate benefits from this trust business by taking advantage on other loyal parties. Blockchain, also known as Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT), adopts peer-to-peer technology to realise decentralisation.

Another attribute is immutability. Once a transaction has been issued, it cannot be modified or forged by any involved parties. To secure transaction records, many consensus algorithms have been introduced. The most famous one is proof-of-work, used by Bitcoin, which require participants to sole hard mathematical problems to get the token to build a new node on Blockchain. This mechanism also prevents malicious users create untrustworthy records due to some induction from Possibility theory and cryptography.

In the future, people would no longer need to take so many boiler-plate processes to make financial business to be trustworthy through Trust Machines.

## Differences Between Database and distributed ledger

Similar to country governments, typical databases are built on one or few machines to maintain data records. Thus, the risk to be attacked and become dysfunction would be a serious issue when dealing sensitive data, such as credit card details. To neutral this issue, distributed ledger technology introduces peer-to-peer scheme to eliminate the possibility that lets hackers to exploit.

On the other hand, even though it is much more secure to use distributed system design to upgrade defensive power, how to synchronise every participants and maintain data correctness would still be a challenge of this system. In fact, computer scientists and mathematicians refer this distributed computing problem as 'Byzantine fault tolerance'(BFT). Furthermore, In 1999, Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov introduced the "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (PBFT) algorithm to provide a high-performance solution to this problem that processes massive requests with low latency(PS1). Today, proof-of-work(POW), one of most famous PBFT implementation, has been wildly integrated in many Blockchain technology, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, etc. due to its easy implementation, ability to scale up, and high security.

Unfortunately, despite the invention of PBFT solutions, which make zero-knowledge proof to be possible, it is still difficult to provide enough high transaction speed, up to several hundreds transaction per second(TPS, as fast as database's, at least 10'000 TPS. Moreover, authorities concerned require financial services to be under control of financial regulation, like MLR or KYC. No doubt, typical database system achieve this requirement without many obstacles, but it still needs much more effort for distributed ledgers to accomplish this policy. Naturally, many country still do not recognise cryptocurrency legal, especially China who has strictly banned every dormitory exchange.
