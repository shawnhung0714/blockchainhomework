# Homework 1

## Trust Machine
In order to reduce massive trust processes in large institutions, such as governments, banks, or other financial firms, a new technology have been developed to reduce the huge cost of these processes while keeping their business still trustworthy. This new technology is called 'Trust Machine', due to the purpose to replace 'Trust companies.'

one feature of this machine is decentralisation. this feature prevents hazards when the central authority has been attacked by DDoS or some corruptive insiders try to gain illegitimate benefits from this trust business by taking advantage on other loyal parties. Blockchain, also known as Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT), adopts peer-to-peer technology to realise decentralisation.

Another attribute is immutability. Once a transaction has been issued, it cannot be modified or forged by any involved parties. To secure transaction records, many consensus algorithms have been introduced. The most famous one is proof-of-work, used by Bitcoin, which require participants to sole hard mathematical problems to get the token to build a new node on Blockchain. This mechanism also prevents malicious users create untrustworthy records due to some induction from Possibility theory and cryptography.

In the future, people would no longer need to take so many boiler-plate processes to make financial business to be trustworthy through Trust Machines.

## Differences Between Database and distributed ledger

Similar to central authority, typical databases only have one or few machines to maintain transaction records. Therefore, the risk to be attack and become dysfunction is higher than distributed system. 

On the other hand, despite high moral and functional risks of DB systems, it is much easier to build high performance computing system through integrating DB system.
