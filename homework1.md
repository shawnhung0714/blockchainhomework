# Homework 1

## Trust Machine
In order to reduce massive authentication in large institutions, such as governments, banks, or other financial firms, a new technology have been developed to reduce the huge cost of these processes while keeping their business still trustworthy. This new technology is called 'Trust Machine', trying to replace 'Trust Companies.', which consume large amount of labour resource.

In the future, people would no longer need to take so many boiler-plate processes to make financial business to be trustworthy through Trust Machines, releasing workers from mundane tasks and promoting result accuracy.

## Differences Between Database and Distributed Ledger

First of all, typical databases are built on one or few machines to maintain data records. Thus, the risk to be attacked and become dysfunction would be a serious issue. To reduce this issue, Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT) introduces peer-to-peer scheme to eliminate the weakness that allows hackers to exploit. 

Secondly, the communication between peers is built under cryptography protection, which increases significant defensive ability againt man-in-the-middle attack, while regular databases may not have secure connection between their companion servers. If some hackers want to manupulate the records on Distributed Ledger, they must provide extremly large computing power to modify just a few blocks. Yet, the expected reward for this exploit is much less than joining regular minging process, induction from its mathemetical model. Thus, these two factors ensure brute-force cracking unpractical.  

Last but not least, even though the record confirmation is much secure in Distributed Ledger than in databases, the performance of DLT, only a few hundreds TPS, is still not match to the later, at least ten thousand TPS.

## Why Blockchain is immutable
Once a block has been created and confirmed validate, each full node on the Blockchain networking
 would have a identical record copy. Generally speaking, there are usually thousands of node running on Blockchain networking, so it requires extremely huge computing power to modify Blockchain history.

 Furthurmore, making a block to be confirmed demands a very high cost, time and computing power already, and it is much higher for hackers to exploit. Compared with regular minging process, it is totally not worth cracking. Therefore, Blockchain is considered to be immutable.

## Blockchain Trust 
Due to the immutability of Blockchain, sensitive data and transactions like online purchasing can be guaranteed to  be completed on this system, and the trasaction records will be archived forever without tampering. Therefore, it accomplishes the most difficult and valueable purpose of traditional Trust Companies, providing customers and financial facilities a good platform to trade, making trust on blockchain possible.

## Smart contract
In order to providing more advanced financial services, such as future trading, insurance, and bank loans, it is necessarily to provide a solid, automatical protocol for both trading parties to conform. 'Smart contract' is the technology supported natively by some DLT, like Ethereum, that runs a small program snippet, though its functions are limited, to ensure conditional transactions to be fulfilled under mutual agreement.
