## Q1:What is a trust machine?

In order to reduce massive authentication in large, security-sensitive institutions, distributed ledger technology(DLT), have been developed to reduce artefactual authentication while automatically keeping their business still trustworthy. This new technology creates automatic trusting, so it is also called 'Trust Machine', trying to replace 'Trust Companies.'

In the future, people would no longer need to take so many mundane tasks by introduction of Trust Machines rather than some institutions.

## Q2:How distributed ledger is different from DB(Data Base)?

First of all, typical databases are built on one or few machines to maintain data records. Thus, the risk to be attacked and become dysfunction would be a serious issue. To reduce this issue, Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT) introduces peer-to-peer scheme to eliminate the weakness that allows hackers to exploit.

Secondly, the communication between peers is built under cryptographic protection, which increases defensive ability againt man-in-the-middle attack, while regular databases may not have sealed connection between their application servers. If some hackers want to twist the records on Distributed Ledger, they must spend extremly large computing power on just a few blocks. Yet, the expected reward of this exploit is much less than joining regular minging process, induction from its mathemetical model. As a result, these two factors ensure brute-force cracking unpractical.

Last but not least, even though the record confirmation is much secure in Distributed Ledger than in databases, the performance of DLT, only a few hundreds TPS, is still not match to the later, at least ten thousand TPS.

## Q3:Why blockchain considered as immutable?

Once a block being created and confirmed validate, each full node on the Blockchain networking will receive an identical copy of this record. Generally speaking, there are usually thousands of full node running on the networking, so it requires extremely huge computing power to modify Blockchain history.

Furthurmore, making a confirmed block demands very high effort, and it is much higher for hackers to do cracking, so it is totally not worth cracking. Therefore, Blockchain is considered to be immutable.

## Q4:How trust is achieved through blockchain?

Due to the immutability of Blockchain, sensitive data and transactions,like online transaction details, can be guaranteed to be true and archived forever without tampering in the system. In other words, it provides a good platform between customers and financial facilities to their trust each other.

## Q5:What is smart contracts?

In order to providing more advanced financial services, like future trading, insurance, and bank loans, it is necessarily to provide a solid, automatical mechanism for both trading parties to conform. 'Smart Contract' is the one supported natively by some DLT, running a small computer program snippet, though its functions limited, to ensure conditional transactions to be fulfilled under mutual agreement.
